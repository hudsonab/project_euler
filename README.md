Python &amp; math practice using Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net

I want to practice python and math skills, so I'm going down the list of problems on Project Euler, starting with the easiest and working my way up.

Solutions for these are widely available, but I'm making my best attempt at solving them before looking up any assistance. Some alternative solutions may come to mind so I'll make multiple files for the same problem. First time around, these solutions will likely not be the most efficient answer so I'm researching more efficient methods to solve common issues.

After I feel like I've worked through a good deal of these problems, I intend to revisit these and see if I can clean up the code with more accurate styling and improve on efficiency.

Also working on my git skills, so this is good practice :)
